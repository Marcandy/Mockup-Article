*This project was a good revision for me. One thing that I learned is "alt" which
should be added in image syntax for alternative description. 
Another concept I learned is the overhall definition of "relative path" when trying to link a file. 

*The HTML structure as trees was very easy for me to understand. The indentation rules, brackets sytax, and header were familiar to me.

*Understanding the figure element was a bit difficult for me. Using the figure suntax in order to put an image and a paragrapgh in an orderly manner.
Aslo figuring this <p>By <strong><em>Christopher Watkins</em></strong></p> in the Format Simple Article was strangely hard to remember

*I have used MDN to reserch syntax I did not know yet like: strike, horizontal rule, and superscrip
I also took notes of new elements I learned like the figure inorder to stuy and remmber them.
